	default_base_moof Movflags = "default_base_moof"
	//Similarly to the ‘omit_tfhd_offset’ flag, this flag avoids writing the absolute base_data_offset field in tfhd atoms, but does so by using the new default-base-is-moof flag instead. This flag is new from 14496-12:2012. This may make the fragments easier to parse in certain circumstances (avoiding basing track fragment location calculations on the implicit end of the previous track fragment).

	delay_moov Movflags = "delay_moov"
	//delay writing the initial moov until the first fragment is cut, or until the first fragment flush

	disable_chpl Movflags = "disable_chpl"
	//Disable Nero chapter markers (chpl atom). Normally, both Nero chapters and a QuickTime chapter track are written to the file. With this option set, only the QuickTime chapter track will be written. Nero chapters can cause failures when the file is reprocessed with certain tagging programs, like mp3Tag 2.61a and iTunes 11.3, most likely other versions are affected as well.

	faststart Movflags = "faststart"

	negative_cts_offsets Movflags = "negative_cts_offsets"
	//Enables utilization of version 1 of the CTTS box, in which the CTS offsets can be negative. This enables the initial sample to have DTS/CTS of zero, and reduces the need for edit lists for some cases such as video tracks with B-frames. Additionally, eases conformance with the DASH-IF interoperability guidelines.

	//This option is implicitly set when writing ‘ismv’ (Smooth Streaming) files.

	omit_tfhd_offset Movflags = "omit_tfhd_offset"

	separate_moof Movflags = "separate_moof"
	//Write a separate moof (movie fragment) atom for each track. Normally, packets for all tracks are written in a moof atom (which is slightly more efficient), but with this option set, the muxer writes one moof/mdat pair for each track, making it easier to separate tracks.

	skip_sidx Movflags = "skip_sidx"
	//Skip writing of sidx atom. When bitrate overhead due to sidx atom is high, this option could be used for cases where sidx atom is not mandatory. When the ‘global_sidx’ flag is enabled, this option is ignored.

	skip_trailer Movflags = "skip_trailer"

	use_metadata_tags Movflags = "use_metadata_tags"
	//use mdta atom for metadata

	//write deprecated gama atom

	hybrid_fragmented Movflags = "hybrid_fragmented"
	//For recoverability - write the output file as a fragmented file. This allows the intermediate file to be read while being written (in particular, if the writing process is aborted uncleanly). When writing is finished, the file is converted to a regular, non-fragmented file, which is more compatible and allows easier and quicker seeking.

	//If writing is aborted, the intermediate file can manually be remuxed to get a regular, non-fragmented file of what had been written into the unfinished file.
