// // 21.57 matroska MATROSKA
type MATROSKA struct {
	Title bool `json:"title" flag:"-title"`
	//Set title name provided to a single track. This gets mapped to the FileDescription element for a stream written as attachment.

	Language string `json:"language" flag:"-language"`
	//Specify the language of the track in the Matroska languages form.

	//The language can be either the 3 letters bibliographic ISO-639-2 (ISO 639-2/B) form (like "fre" for French), or a language code mixed with a country code for specialities in languages (like "fre-ca" for Canadian French).

	StereoMode StereoMode `json:"stereo_mode" flag:"-stereo_mode"`
	//Set stereo 3D video layout of two views in a single video track.
	//==============

	ReserveIndexSpace typex.Index `json:"reserve_index_space" flag:"-reserve_index_space"`
	//By default, this muxer writes the index for seeking (called cues in Matroska terms) at the end of the file, because it cannot know in advance how much space to leave for the index at the beginning of the file. However for some use cases – e.g. streaming where seeking is possible but slow – it is useful to put the index at the beginning of the file.

	//If this option is set to a non-zero value, the muxer will reserve size bytes of space in the file header and then try to write the cues there when the muxing finishes. If the reserved space does not suffice, no Cues will be written, the file will be finalized and writing the trailer will return an error. A safe size for most use cases should be about 50kB per hour of video.

	//Note that cues are only written if the output is seekable and this option will have no effect if it is not.

	CuesToFront typex.UBool `json:"cues_to_front" flag:"-cues_to_front"`
	//If set, the muxer will write the index at the beginning of the file by shifting the main data if necessary. This can be combined with reserve_index_space in which case the data is only shifted if the initially reserved space turns out to be insufficient.

	//This option is ignored if the output is unseekable.

	ClusterSizeLimit typex.Limit `json:"cluster_size_limit" flag:"-cluster_size_limit"`
	//Store at most the provided amount of bytes in a cluster.

	//If not specified, the limit is set automatically to a sensible hardcoded fixed value.

	ClusterTimeLimit typex.Limit `json:"cluster_time_limit" flag:"-cluster_time_limit"`
	//Store at most the provided number of milliseconds in a cluster.

	//If not specified, the limit is set automatically to a sensible hardcoded fixed value.

	Dash typex.UBool `json:"dash" flag:"-dash"`
	//Create a WebM file conforming to WebM DASH specification. By default it is set to false.

	DashTrackNumber typex.UNumber `json:"dash_track_number" flag:"-dash_track_number"`
	//Track number for the DASH stream. By default it is set to 1.

	Live typex.UBool `json:"live" flag:"-live"`
	//Write files assuming it is a live stream. By default it is set to false.

	AllowRawVfw typex.UBool `json:"allow_raw_vfw" flag:"-allow_raw_vfw"`
	//Allow raw VFW mode. By default it is set to false.

	FlippedRawRgb typex.UBool `json:"flipped_raw_rgb" flag:"-flipped_raw_rgb"`
	//If set to true, store positive height for raw RGB bitmaps, which indicates bitmap is stored bottom-up. Note that this option does not flip the bitmap which has to be done manually beforehand, e.g. by using the ‘vflip’ filter. Default is false and indicates bitmap is stored top down.

	WriteCrc32 typex.UBool `json:"write_crc32" flag:"-write_crc32"`
	//Write a CRC32 element inside every Level 1 element. By default it is set to true. This option is ignored for WebM.

	DefaultMode DefaultMode `json:"default_mode" flag:"-default_mode"`
	//Control how the FlagDefault of the output tracks will be set. It influences which tracks players should play by default. The default mode is ‘passthrough’.
